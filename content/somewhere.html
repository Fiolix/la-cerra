<!-- Summary -->
<section class="sector-summary">
  <div class="text-preview">
    Somewhere is the closest sector if you are staying at La Cerra. In fact, the boulders are located within 5 minutes walking distance from the campsite - perfect to work on some projects before breakfast or a late ascent after dinner. The boulders are mostly of low to moderate height and offer ideal drop zones. You will find rather easier problems up to Fb 6b but some harder projects on Big Piggy are still waiting to be checked off. In combination with the close proximity to the campsite, Somewhere represents an ideal sector for families with smaller children or beginners, and is perfect to get used to the rough granite on your first day at La Cerra. As an added advantage, the farm dogs will probably enjoy this sector along with you.
