<!-- Summary -->
<section class="sector-summary">
  <div class="text-preview">
    This sector is the oldest in La Cerra and was first cleaned by the Sardinia Bloc Scouting Team (sponsored by La Sportiva) in 2013. This expedition left us with a bunch of beautiful problems that can be reached in 5 to 10 minutes from the campsite. While the boulders located further downhill are mostly of comfortable heights with nice drop zones, the boulders further uphill are a bit higher and it might be a good idea to bring an extra crashpad and a spotter. Please note, that the designated path gets reclaimed by the macchia wuite easily. In general, grades are mostly Fb 6a to 7a but at Blocco de Nalle you will als find one of the hardest problems of La Cerra (Fb 7c). Boulder 3 might be a nice basecamp to spend a day in this sector. It is easy to reach, offers quite good shade even on sunny days and the other boulders are close by.
